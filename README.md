Normalizes strings which represent file paths

To run, compile the file normalize.java using the command: javac -g normalize.java.

Then you can run it using it the command: java normalize

The program will then prompt you to input a string to be normalized.

Once you input the string that represents the file path and press Enter, it will immediately output the normalized version of that file path on the next line.

You can continue typing and pressing Enter to test different file paths.

To exit the program, you can just press CTRL-c.
